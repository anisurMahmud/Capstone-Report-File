\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

In the present world, we are currently seeing a boom in social media popularity and
ecommerce sites. More than half of the world uses social media for different
interactions and a quarter of the people now prefer ecommerce sites for purchases
of different necessities. The use of texts in these sites is seen excessively as people
share their opinions as posts, blogs and reviews in social media and reviews of
products in different ecommerce sites. As a result, we now have a very big resource
in our hand which can be used for providing tailor made services for the customers
by service providers. Determining emotion from texts can help us reach a verdict
on a topic or a product from thousands or millions of people. It will be possible to
determine whether a service is appreciated or hated by the people simply from their
posts, reviews in an instant, saving tons of time and playing a big role in product
improvement. Furthermore, it can be also applied in applications such as emotion
retrieval from suicide notes, detecting insulting sentences in chat conversations and
so on. Therefore, a better method of detecting emotion from text based data is very
crucial in the modern world.
