% You need to change the text for abstract
Messages, comments, letters and basically anything that is written by a human being most of the times conveys a string emotions. Understanding and analysing these emotions in large capacity can be used for the greater good and achieve technological advancement at the same time in the field of deep learning. The objective is to predict the emotion of text data in terms of joy, sadness, anger, love, fear and surprise. in this project, LSTM(a deep learning algorithm) network architecture have been used to analyse emotions for given text. The experimental evaluations has been performed on emotion data-set from kaggle which contains 16000 records with different emotions. Validation Accuracy is the evaluation metrics used to analyze emotions in this project.
