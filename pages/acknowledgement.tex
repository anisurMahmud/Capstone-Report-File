We would like to pay our gratitude to the Almighty Allah who created us with all the abilities to understand analysis and develop the process with patience.

I would like to thank the following people for their help in the completion of the project.

We are thankful to our project supervisor Mr. Md. Mamun Hossain, Assistant Professor, Computer Science \& Engineering Department, Bangladesh University of Business \& Technology for his professional guidance and motivation during the work of this project which is a major part of it. Without his valuable support and guidance, this project could not reach this level of development from our point of view.

A very special gratitude goes out to all our friends for their support and help to implement our works. The discussions with them on various topics of our works have been very helpful for us to enrich our knowledge and conception regarding the work.

Last but not the least, we are highly grateful to our parents and family members for supporting us spiritually throughout writing this report and our life in general.
